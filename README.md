A GH action for validating the presence of release notes in pull requests.

## Motivation

This action is designed to help maintainers and contributors ensure that release notes are present in pull requests. It can be used to prevent common issues such as:
- Missing release notes
- Incomplete release notes
- Incorrect release note formats
- Release notes in the wrong location

## Impact to Users
The users are expected to provide the release notes in the pull request body. See example:
```markdown
Release Notes:                          .... also valid: ## Release Notes:
- 1st line of PR's release notes
- 2nd line of PR's release notes
```

This section can be placed anywhere in the pull request body. The action will search for the release notes based on the provided title text. _Hint:_ The title can be chapter name, the Markdown format tags are ignored.

## Requirements
- **GitHub Token**: A GitHub token with permission to fetch repository data such as Issues and Pull Requests.
- **Python 3.11+**: Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.

## Inputs

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Description**: Your GitHub token for authentication. Store it as a secret and reference it in the workflow file as secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN.
- **Required**: Yes

### `pr-number`
- **Description**: The pull request number to check for release notes. Example: `1`.
- **Required**: Yes

### `github-repository`
- **Description**: The GitHub repository to check for version tags. Example: `AbsaOSS/release-notes-presence-check`.
- **Required**: Yes

### `location`
- **Description**: The location of the release notes in the pull request.
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: `body`

### `title`
- **Description**: The title of the release notes in the pull request. Example without regex: `Release Notes:`, with regex: `[Rr]elease [Nn]otes:`.
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: `[Rr]elease [Nn]otes:`

### `skip-labels`
- **Description**: The labels to skip the release notes check. Example: `skip-release-notes`.
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: ``

### `skip-placeholders`
- **Description**: Comma-separated placeholder tokens (e.g., `TBD`, `ToDo`). This option allows using a PR template with a predefined “Release Notes” heading without causing automatic passes. If any placeholder appears at the start of the first release-notes bullet, the check fails, ensuring authors replace template text with real notes.
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: ``

## Usage

### Adding the Action to Your Workflow

See the default action step definition:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5.1.1
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'

- name: Release Notes Presence Check
  id: release_notes_presence_check
  uses: AbsaOSS/release-notes-presence-check@v0.4.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
  with:
    github-repository: ${{ github.repository }}
    pr-number: ${{ github.event.number }} 
    location: "body"
    title: "[Rr]elease [Nn]otes:"
    skip-labels: "skip-release-notes,no-release-notes"
    skip-placeholders: "TBD,ToDo"
```

## Running Static Code Analysis

This project uses Pylint tool for static code analysis. Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces, coding standards, looks for code smells etc.

Pylint displays a global evaluation score for the code, rated out of a maximum score of 10.0. We are aiming to keep our code quality high above the score 9.5.

### Set Up Python Environment
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Pylint tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Pylint
Run Pylint on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Pylint on a specific file, follow the pattern `pylint <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
pylint ./release_notes_presence_check/release_notes_presence_check_action.py
``` 

## Run Black Tool Locally
This project uses the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) tool for code formatting.
Black aims for consistency, generality, readability and reducing git diffs.
The coding style used can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP 8.

The project root file `pyproject.toml` defines the Black tool configuration.
In this project we are accepting the line length of 120 characters.

Follow these steps to format your code with Black locally:

### Set Up Python Environment
From terminal in the root of the project, run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will also install a Black tool, since it is listed in the project requirements.

### Run Black
Run Black on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
black $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Black on a specific file, follow the pattern `black <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
black ./release_notes_presence_check/release_notes_presence_check_action.py
``` 

### Expected Output
This is the console expected output example after running the tool:
```shell
All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file reformatted.
```

## Run my[py] Tool Locally

This project uses the [my[py]](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
tool which is a static type checker for Python.

> Type checkers help ensure that you’re using variables and functions in your code correctly.
> With my[py], add type hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs,
> and my[py] will warn you when you use those types incorrectly.
my[py] configuration is in `pyproject.toml` file.

Follow these steps to format your code with my[py] locally:

### Run my[py]

Run my[py] on all files in the project.
```shell
  mypy .
```

To run my[py] check on a specific file, follow the pattern `mypy <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py --check-untyped-defs`.

Example:
```shell
   mypy release_notes_presence_check/release_notes_presence_check.py
``` 

### Expected Output

This is the console expected output example after running the tool:
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

## Running Unit Test

Unit tests are written using pytest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
pytest tests/
```

This will execute all tests located in the tests directory.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is collected using pytest-cov coverage tool. To run the tests and collect coverage information, use the following command:

```shell
pytest --cov=. -v tests/ --cov-fail-under=80
```

This will execute all tests located in the tests directory and generate a code coverage report.

See the coverage report on the path:

```shell
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Run Action Locally
Create *.sh file and place it in the project root.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure that Python virtual environment is activated
if [ ! -d ".venv" ]; then
  echo "Python virtual environment not found. Creating one..."
  python3 -m venv .venv
fi

source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check if GITHUB_TOKEN is set
if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "Error: GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is not set."
  exit 1
fi

# Set necessary environment variables
export INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN"
export INPUT_PR_NUMBER=109
export INPUT_GITHUB_REPOSITORY="AbsaOSS/generate-release-notes"
export INPUT_LOCATION="body"
export INPUT_TITLE="[Rr]elease notes:"
export INPUT_SKIP_LABELS="skip-release-notes,another-skip-label"
export INPUT_SKIP_PLACEHOLDERS="TBD,ToDo"

# Run the main script
python main.py
```
